    🚶‍♂️ #SMARTSTRIDE
SmartStride is a mobile health app designed to help older adults improve both their cognitive and motor functions through dual-task training. By combining walking exercises with adaptive cognitive challenges, SmartStride supports safer mobility, sharper memory, and greater independence in daily life.


     🧠 What the App Does
  Adaptive Cognitive Exercise Prompts
SmartStride initiates a baseline test and then presents users with memory or reasoning challenges while they walk. Based on walking rhythm and performance, the difficulty of cognitive tasks automatically adjusts to the user’s current ability.

  Step Feedback
Using motion sensors from a smartwatch or smartphone, SmartStride monitors walking rhythm and provides real-time vibratory feedback to reinforce consistent step timing and promote safe walking patterns.

  Step Timing Assistance
Automatically calibrates a personalized walking pace, with manual adjustment options. The watch or phone then vibrates in sync with each step to help users maintain this pace.

  Session Tracking & Long-Term Data Collection
Tracks dual-task performance, including step regularity, cognitive task accuracy, and response time. All results are stored for long-term monitoring and future analysis, helping caregivers or users track changes over time.


   📲 How SmartStride Works
SmartStride is thoughtfully designed for older adults, featuring a simple interface, large font sizes, and bright, high-contrast colors to ensure accessibility and ease of use. Every screen is optimized to reduce cognitive load and support independent use.


   🧭 App Flow Overview

👋 Welcome Screen (WelcomePage.js)

A cheerful and clear welcome message appears:
“Striving to improve cognitive health in the community.”

Users press “START” button to begin.


🧠 Assessment Check (EntryPage.js)

The app asks: “Have you taken the assessment test?”

Two large buttons, “YES” and “NO,” allow users to easily respond.

If “NO” is selected, the user completes a short cognitive test to establish a baseline.

If “YES” is selected, the user skips straight to the cognitive walking challenge.

📝 Cognitive Assessment

Multiple-choice questions are displayed one at a time in large, clearly labeled buttons.

Users can go back or skip a question at any time, reducing pressure.

🎯 Challenge Task (Prompt Mode)

After the assessment, or directly if “YES” was selected, users are prompted with a challenge

They respond verbally or mentally while walking, then press “COMPLETE” or “SKIP” using large, high-contrast buttons.

This intuitive step-by-step process supports both new and returning users, enabling accessible and effective dual-task training that adapts to their needs.
